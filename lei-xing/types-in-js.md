# Types in JS

## Type system

In programming languages, a **type system** is a set of rules that assigns a property called type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules. These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components \(e.g. "string", "array of float", "function returning boolean"\). The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically \(at compile time\), dynamically \(at run time\), or as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch, providing a form of documentation, etc.
